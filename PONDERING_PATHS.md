#The root: I learned that we use **/** symbol when we need to acccess the file.

#Program and absolute paths: Learned what is an absolute path.Challenge given was easy.

#Position thy self: Really loved the name.Learned about the **cd** command.We also learned that **~** this depicts that we are in the home directory.

#Position elsewhere: I used **cd** command to change the directory.

#Position yet elsewhere: I first ran the command and the terminal gave me hint where the file is actually located and I changed my directory to it.

#Implicit relative paths: I learnd that we dont need to actually write the whole subsidary file's absolute path from the root if I'm already in the parent directory.The **..** refers to root directory for a file.
 
#Explicit relative paths: **.** is used to refer to the the same directory you are in.

#Home sweet Home: I was asked to run a command /challenge/run and pass an argumnet in the home directory while asking me to keep the argument of 3 letters so it was obvious to sustitute /home/hacker with ~ and the other character was **/** itself and the last character could be any alphabet or number, I used **t**.
